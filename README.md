## Abstract
Early detection of mitral valve (MV) structural complications is a crucial clinical need. Key advances in deep learning-based
segmentation have not yet been leveraged for MV detection in cardiac
magnetic resonance imaging (CMR), a promising opportunity towards
assisted MV disease diagnostics. To address this gap, we introduce Deep-
Valve, an automated pipeline for MV detection using CMR. DeepValve
builds on existing approaches by comparing known methodologies (U-
Net architectures, fine-tuned for regression and segmentation analysis:
UNET-REG and UNET-SEG) and introducing a novel hybrid model
(DSNT-REG), adapted from a recent automatic segmentation study in
echocardiography. We propose metrics tailored for quality assessment of
predicted thin structures based on Procrustes analysis.
