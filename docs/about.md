# DeepValve
DeepValve is the first  deep learning   pipeline for mitral valve detection using CMR. We tested three valve detection models: a keypoint-regression model (UNET-REG), a segmentation model (UNET-SEG) and a hybrid model based on keypoint detection (DSNT-REG). We also propose  metrics, newly tailored, for evaluating the quality of mitral valve detection, including Procrustes-based metrics  for the regression models and customized Dice-based metrics for segmentation models.
